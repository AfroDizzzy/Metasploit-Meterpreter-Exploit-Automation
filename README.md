# Metasploit-Meterpreter-Exploit-Automation
This is the Cyber471 final project and required the exploitation of a machine running the Metasploitable2 operating system. 
The OS running the attack was Kali Linux which naturally had metasploit installed. 

All machines were ran as virtual machines on a virtual network (was not connected to the outside web)

The unique python libraries used include:
a python library of metasploit - https://github.com/DanMcInerney/pymetasploit3
a python lirbary of nmap - https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/

Further work includes implementing persistance on metasploit and the control of a botnet of exploited machines.
